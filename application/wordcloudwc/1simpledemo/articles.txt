1.	In Another WorldHere I am, in China, half way around the world from home. As I look at my clock and calculate the time back home I realize that half a world away, people are busy getting ready for a wedding. The bride is my niece, a person I first met when she was three days old.I think back to the first time I had the opportunity to become acquainted with my niece. As my sister cradled her in her arms, the infant girl clasped her mother's outstretched finger.My intuition told me that her temperament would be a sunny disposition, a joy to people around her.As she grew, the cute little girl had an infectious laugh that started as a small grin, then became a giggle and grew louder and louder until it triggered a response from all the people around her and they joined in.As an adolescent, she studied hard and enjoyed welldeserved success in secondary school as she interacted with her peer group.After receiving her high school diploma, she chose nursing as her career.From the beginning of the young couples romance it was evident that they were compatible and were completely intrigued with each other.The couple had an engagement party when I was at home in Canada a few months ago. The party was in the form of a picnic in a beautiful rose garden. To celebrate and to toast their future, we drank champagne. As they posed under an arch covered with climbing roses, we snapped pictures for their photo album.The couple decided on a fall wedding.Plans for the wedding day were activated immediately. The decisions about the forthcoming event were shared by the whole family. A close friend of the family was contacted and invited to sing a solo just prior to the ceremony. The day before the ceremony, a rehearsal would take place so that the remainder of the details could be looked after and attended to. The planning that takes place beforehand for one of these events and all the work that the big day entails, with many people collaborating to make the event run smoothly, are immense. The conscientious attention to detail will be evident to the spectators of this event. I can imagine the excitement and emotions of the family today.The time is near.The ceremony will begin in 3 short hours. The bride will be radiant as she comes down the aisle escorted by her father.She will wear her grandmother's pearls as an accessory.Her veil will be the same one as her cousin wore last year.As is customary, under her garments she will wear a blue garter.As part of the tradition of Canadian weddings, she will be wearing something old (the pearls), something new (her gown), something borrowed (the veil) and something blue (the garter).As the first chords of the wedding march are played (a melody familiar to all), the congregation will rise.Gasps will be heard as they catch a glimpse of the bride in her gorgeous wedding gown.The mother of the bride will calmly view this whole event, though tears will blur her vision.She will be overcome with sentiment at her daughter's apparent happiness.The picture will be one that will embody hope for the future of humanity.As the couple exchange wedding vows they will be affirming their love and making a commitment to each other. All the spectators are there to wish them well.As the time approaches, I think back to other family weddings over many years.My older sisters were all married in the same church and as brides they carried a white Bible decorated with tiny roses. The receptions for their weddings were all held in the same church basement, as there was no large banquet hall in the local area.The feast was usually catered by a group of church members. Today's wedding reception will be held in an arena that will be decorated with just the right amount of fall flowers in wonderful arrays to give it dignity yet a touch of glamour.The table decorations will be a masterpiece. One of the table decorations will be small pumpkins, used as containers for flowers that were collected from family gardens, surrounded by a large wreath made from long stalks of wheat. There will be a few coloured leaves placed inside the wreath.Maybe they will use oak and maple leaves to show the splendour of the autumn colours. The colour of the outfits that the bridesmaids are wearing will be fall colours as well. The ingenious decorations will be appreciated by the many guests attending the festivities. At each place setting there will be a special paper napkin with the bride and groom's name printed on it and the date of their wedding. It will be carefully folded placed on top and of a linen napkin. This will be one of the souvenirs the guests will have to commemorate the special wedding day.Also at each place will be a few after dinner mints for the guests. A miniature tree will also be placed at each persons place. The intent is for the guests to take the little tree home and transplant it to a special place. In this way, our environment is also improved and the tree will become a living tribute to the young couple.The groom will carry her across the threshold as is customary for a young couple as they begin their new life together. The honeymoon plans will take them to the west coast of Canada.They will have a week of privacy far away from friends and family. They will inhabit a condominium in the town of Whistler, British Columbia, in the Rocky Mountains. They will feel as if they are royalty living in a mansion in this little bit of paradise on earth. Thereafter, they will return home to Ontario where they will reside. Their original plan to spend their honeymoon on board a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea was abandoned when world circumstances dictated that our country Canada was a safer choice.Earlier this month, as I thought about the forthcoming marriage, and knew that I would be unable to attend, I decided to write a message to the young couple. The intent was that the message would be read aloud during the wedding reception. In the message, I wished them well and urged them to cherish each other every day.2.	Let's Dress Up����It's HalloweenFrom early childhood getting dressed up is connected with a special pastime in North America, called Halloween.Halloween is celebrated on the last night of October, when the air is crisp and snow is not far off. Every young child is acquainted with this exciting tradition. On the last day of October when dinner is finished,children hurry to dress up in a costume. Darkness comes early at this time of year and caution must be practiced, foremost by the children who are going from house to house, ��trick or treat��.Parents warn their children not to dart out in front of cars. In all the excitement it is easy for children to become distracted and ignore safety rules. Planning what your costume will be, ahead of time, is part of the fun of the evening. Many mothers will spend time fabricating outfits for their little girls who suddenly turn into circus clowns, beautiful ballet dancers or weird colorful bugs. Fathers may help their sons construct a costume of foil armor.Little boys often enjoy pretending they are in the army so on Halloween it is possible to see squads of lieutenants and sergeants marching along in the dark. We affiliate this celebration with the supernatural so some children may choose to wear a skeleton costume bearing a skull and crossbones, or even a monster costume. The choice of wardrobe for the evening is really limitless. Witches can be seen riding on broomsticks across well illuminated intersections. Earlier in the evening they may have concocted a witch's brew to quench their thirst for their arrival home.Ghosts can be heard groaning and moaning while they glide along city streets. Beautiful butterflies flutter by on their way to a party. Pirates carrying swords and pistols roam about, patches over one eye. Small aliens search for a new home here on Earth. Wearing a cape and mask allows a child to become Superman for a few hours and enter the world of fantasy.An ethnic flavor is introduced as a band of gypsies dance along under a bright full moon.Of course you can always see a certain number of Native American costumes, the buckskin jackets and dresses decorated with fringe and beads.Some youngsters choose to decorate only their faces with grease paint instead of wearing masks. In many ways this is safer for a child, making visibility clearer. At the same time a mask allows them to remain anonymous to all but their closest friends.Usually, on the night before Halloween, family members gather together to carve a pumpkin. On Halloween night the candle lit face of the pumpkin shines from each home welcoming the little ghosts and goblins to call. Parents usually escort small children around their own neighborhood helping to keep them safe. Small children only visit random houses, their parent's friends mostly, while older children knock at every door. Crowding onto the front porch of the house the children rap at the door and chant the refrain ��trick or treat��.Householders distribute candies, apples, peanuts, or any edible treat into decorated wooden six quart baskets, or plastic bags. They may be asked to recite a poem or sing a song before receiving their treat. Some lucky children may receive cookies from a freshly baked batch of chocolate chip cookies. On arriving home the children will dump all the junk candy out onto the floor to examine their loot. Usually there is a great racket as brothers and sisters compare what goodies they have collected.Adults, too, like to join in Halloween celebrations by attending small house parties or large group gatherings at halls or arenas. They may play the old traditional games such as bobbing for apples, which float in tubs of water, telling ghost stories and visiting a haunted house.Everyone seems to get enjoyment from being slightly afraid.If you live in the country the hooting of an owl or even the howl of a wolf underlines the spooky atmosphere of Halloween evening. Clouds scuttle across the face of the moon and the flap of a bird's wings can be heard as it settles on the bare branches of a tree. Eyes gleam in the night as a black cat crosses your path. Bats swoop about in the dark startling those who are nervous. On this evening it is not necessary to be extravagant to have a good time.A little imagination and a sense of fun will create a memory of Halloween night for many years.3.	GardeningOne of the quiet joys of life in the southern part of Ontario, Canada, is gardening.Whether pursued as a hobby or solely to improve the esthetic value of one's home, the pleasure derived is only exceeded by the therapeutic benefit. The exercise involved in working in a garden is helpful in keeping people in good physical condition. It has become a ritual for homeowners to spend late winter weekends browsing through seed catalogues while sitting on their couch. They make lists of items they wish to purchase and often make notations right on the catalogue as they make decisions about this year's garden.If they order early, there is usually a discount coupon, allowing a percentage of the cost to be deducted from the price.Often the coupon needs to be detached from the catalogue and mailed to the company along with the order. This is an extra bonus for the consumer. The investment cost required is nominal when the amount of pleasure generated is considered. The seed companies will usually warrant the plants, and often a refund is offered if the plants do not thrive. The shipment from the seed company's warehouse is awaited with eager anticipation. Its appearance means that spring will soon arrive.The glossy pages of the catalogues provide a preview of the visual delights that can be grown. Pictures show an array of flowers that dazzle the eye. There are monochromatic displays as well as others that are a fusion of the complete spectrum of the rainbow's colors. Also included in the publication are pictures and descriptions of vegetables, shrubs, and trees.Avid gardeners subscribe to magazines that specialize in articles and ads about this enjoyable pastime and people literally read each issue from cover to cover. Descriptions of plants include implicit instructions on whether to plant them in sun or shade. Specification as to the amount of irrigation required is also stated.Elaborate irrigation systems are sometimes installed or a trench for improving the water flow is used. Controls are needed on irrigation systems because if the ground becomes too saturated the soil in the garden will be too muddy to allow anyone to work in it until it dries out.If there is too much water constantly, the garden will become a swamp and impossible to cultivate. (Many people like to preserve the natural habitat of birds and wildlife in a marsh. These areas are usually protected by the government and although important to our environment, are not considered gardens.)Geographic location is important for plants.Certain plants are only suitable for propagation close to the equator. Others need to be several degrees of latitude away from the equator. Longitude is also a factor and most companies clearly state the conditions that will provide the optimum chances for the plants survival.Canadians grow tulips imported from Holland and they do well in the Southern Ontario climate.Because it is late spring before plants can survive outdoors in Southern Ontario, it is common for people to start their plants indoors.Seeds are planted in small containers and continue to grow indoors until the appropriate size is achieved. Sometimes ultraviolet light is used to encourage plant growth. When the mercury rises and the danger of frost is past, the plants are then transplanted to the garden or to a flowerbed.Plants are nourished from the soil, but to provide optimum food, fertilizer can be applied to encourage vigorous growth. Sometimes fertilizer is diluted with water while other kinds are dispersed with a spreader that flings the fertilizer granules in a small radius around the plants. The water soluble fertilizer will then be absorbed into the soil the next time it rains. Just as people need minerals, such as calcium and zinc, to be healthy, plants also need minerals but phosphorous and nitrogen are better food for them.Some gardeners plan their garden with meticulous attention to detail.They choose colors that will complement each other and design their garden as if they were painting on a canvas.Others are more spontaneous and simply visit a nursery and purchase plants that appeal to them. Often gardeners have a trademark plant that is their specialty.Perhaps they enjoy the velvet texture of the leaves, or maybe the flower's color attracts them. The varieties of gardens are endless. Terrace gardening has become popular. With a herbal garden, cooks enjoy being able to use fresh herbs from their garden to add zest to their favorite dishes. They simply visit their garden and clip a few pieces of the herb they wish to use.Every garden is as individual as its owner.Gardens come in all shapes and sizes. Some are in the shape of a rectangle, while others are circular or irregular in shape. Some gardeners like the appearance of an asymmetrical shape while others work to achieve symmetry in their gardens.For vegetable gardens, the most popular shape is rectangular and vegetables are usually planted in a linear fashion. This method makes it easier to cultivate between the rows of plants.You could mistake some gardens for a meadow when the gardener chooses to include only wildflowers as a choice of vegetation. Including a pond in a garden is popular too.Entrepreneurs are always looking for innovations and gadgets that will attract the attention of devoted gardeners and induce them to spend their money. It has become a huge industry in the last few years, as the baby boomers reach retirement age and have more time to pursue hobbies such as gardening.There are new products patented every year to tempt the gardener.It is possible to buy a kit that contains a complete set of tools needed by the home gardener. Unfortunately, often the quality is poor and the product is a fraud. Instead of having something good to work with, the purchase turns out to be junk.If you want to flatter a gardener, and boost their ego at the same time, summon up the courage to simply ask if you can swap plants.Of course, it will give them a thrill if you also compliment them on the hardiness of their plants as compared to yours. They might even try to console you on your lack of competence as a gardener because your plants are not as sturdy as their plants.Irrespective of the competence of the gardener, anyone who augments the number of plants grown is helping to conserve our planet by averting erosion.This pays great dividends for everyone as it also serves to protect the ozone layer.Some people erect barricades to keep small animals from attacking the plants. Squirrels love to dig up flower bulbs. They find them a tasty treat.It is common to see ceramic fixtures or figurines in a garden. Even the untrained eye can tell that the imitations are a fake, yet properly placed, they add to the intrinsic beauty.A rain gauge, attached by a bracket to a fence, is a common sight and is used to enable the gardener to diagnose the moisture level of the soil around the plants and determine if they need more water. If nature does not provide enough rain, then the gardener will use a plastic or rubber hose to provide more irrigation. With a twist of a knob, or by moving a lever, the thirst of the plants for moisture can be quenched.What greater pleasure, than to work in your garden and as you clip the overgrown plants back to size or prune branches of fruit trees, hear the buzz of bees?You know that they are enjoying your garden as they extract the pollen from the blooms. You relish the feeling that you are one with nature. The hum of insects as they share the garden is more pleasurable than music from a stereo or a symphony to a devoted gardener.In addition,the scent of the flowers is an integral part of the joy of spending time working in a garden.The irony of the situation is that nature sometimes conspires against the gardener, and a hailstorm can riddle beautiful plants, shredding their leaves in minutes. Hurricanes can uproot even the largest trees although this is an event that seldom occurs in Southern Ontario. Tornadoes are more likely in this area.Parasites can attack plants and threaten their survival.Any number of things can become a plague. It is often difficult to discern exactly what it is that is destroying the precious plants. Any number of complications can shatter the gardener's dreamof surpassing last year's accomplishment. An authentic gardener will not brood about the disappointment for long. Even as the disaster is occurring, you might overhear the gardener murmur ��There's always next year.��4.	A Canadian Family StoryMy story begins in Newfoundland where my brother and I were born during the Second World War.The island of Newfoundland, which was originally a British colony, became the newest province of Canada in 1949, the same year that the People's Republic of China was born.Our mother was born and raised in Newfoundland.During the War (World War II), she worked in St. John's, the capital city, where she met a young Canadian sailor from Ontario. He was a member of the crew of a �� Canadian Navy ship that was part of one of the convoys that escorted supply ships across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe during the war. They fell in love and subsequently, got married.The rest is history, so to speak.Our family moved to Ontario in late 1945, just after the war ended.In 1999, acting on impulse, my brother and I decided to take our mother to Newfoundland for a visit. It had been almost fifty years since we had last visited our mother's outport (remote or very rural island village) where she grew up. It was also the 50th anniversary of Newfoundland's becoming part of Canada.In 1950, I was six and my brother was five when we last visited our mother's childhood home. At that time, Ireland's Eye was a vibrant, quaint fishing village hugging the rocky shore of a small, enclosed harbour. There was no electricity. There were no roads, no automobiles, and few signs of automation of any type. There were oil lamps and wood stoves in the homes and mere sootpaths between the aggregate of small communities on the hilly island, also named Ireland's Eye. We can still see and hear the inboard motorboats, putt putting (sound of engines) into the harbour, hauling their day's catch of fish. The image of hardy fishermen with pitchforks hoisting and tossing the codfish up to the stilted platforms from the bowels of the boats is still quite vivid. The aroma of salted, drying codfish, lingers still.What I remember best, of almost half a century ago,was going out with my Uncle Fred in his boat to fish. That particular day, we were huddled together and lashed to other boats, just outside of the harbour. I can still hear the lively gossip between my uncle and the other fishermen, above the rippling and splashing of the waves against the hulls of the boats. I remember the boats heaving periodically, on the huge gently rolling waves.My Uncle Fred had only one arm, but amazingly, he could do everything as if he had two hands. He could even roll a cigarette and light it.These are my memories of the quaint Newfoundland glory days gone by. It was a very hard life in those out ports, but a life romantically cherished by most of those who lived it.Our mother was not feeling up to the trip at the time we were ready to leave, but insisted that my brother and I go on this odyssey. We would later provide her with pictures, a written account, and videotape of the trip.Although we toured other parts of Newfoundland, including an overnight stay on the French Islands of St. Pierre and Miquilon, just off the south coast of Newfoundland, our main objective was to visit Ireland's Eye. This necessitated finding water transportation. We managed to arrange for a boat to take us on the half hour trip to the island. As it turned out, the married couple who ferried us over to the island was actually a couple of our distant cousins, whom we had never met.We had intended to have our cousins drop us off on the island and pick us up a few hours later. However, either because we were newly found cousins, or they were typically hospitable Newfoundlanders, or they thought that my brother and I would get lost, they wanted to stay with us. Probably all three factors influenced their decision. They were absolutely fabulous.They got caught up in what my brother and Iwere trying to do. They were very knowledgeable about the island and the people who had once lived there. Clutching a narrative of the island, written by another of our cousins, the forgotten history of that special place became more coherent to the four of us.As we entered Ireland's Eye's small harbour, which was guarded, by a family of hawks in a nest high on a rocky point, a weird sensation came over us. There, in front of us,was the place we visited fifty years before, and about which we had heard and read so much throughout our adult lives. We thought, what an aesthetically breathtaking sight!The glittering sun, on that day, gave everything a picture postcard image. This was indeed a slice of paradise.The ruins of a few remaining buildings that dotted the hillsides and shoreline and the once dominant St. Georges Church on the hill at the end of the harbour, aroused in us an exciting sense of history and of our heritage.Looking out over the harbour from the hill by the church at the extinct community, revived memories of fifty years before.With a greater clarity of the knowledge of the area, we walked from the church a little farther inland to what used to be the post office and the school that our mother attended, the skeletal shells of which were still standing precariously. From there, stopping periodically to eat some edible berries, we struggled behind our cousins through the heavily brush and shrub covered footpaths to Black Duck Cove to visit the cemetery where our grandmother, whom we never knew, was buried.This sacred ground was in very bad condition, with many badly corroded gravestones buried under brush and long grass.After searching for a few minutes in the midst of tangled vegetation, we found our grandmother's resting place beside which we paid our respects. It was a good thing that our cousins stayed with us, as the footpaths that traversed the island, were overgrown with brush.It would have been virtually impossible for my brother and me, to walk to the other communities on the island.We made our way back to the church on the hill and descended to the boat for a half hour boat ride to the other side of the island.Sailing through a number of islets, we arrived at what remains of the small village of Traytown, where our grandparents had lived. There, we met some more long lost relatives at a small cottage. One, a bit of an eccentric, who now lives in Toronto but takes summer refuge in Traytown, showed us the remnants of what had once been our grandparents'house.Beside these ruins, was the still flourishing cluster of wild rose bushes, planted there many years ago by our step grandmother. A lot of people, many whom were more lost cousins, continually dropped in or gathered on the porch outside.After a cup of tea and some more chitchat (small talk) and some comic relief,we made our departure for the mainland. On the way, we passed other inlets with ghost communities on Ireland's Eye. To add to the excitement of that special day, my brother spotted a humpback whale quite close,between the boat and the island.Our visit to Ireland's Eye was a bittersweet experience for us.On the one hand, there was a sense of being at the very place where our relatives and ancestors had lived, worked and played. On the other hand, there was a sense of agonizing loss of what were once thriving communities on the island.It was difficult to reconcile the past with the present, after a gap of fifty years of chronic degeneration of the communities. Today, the area is notorious for smuggling. However, our mission was invaluable in that we were able to find out more about ourselves.The entire expedition to Newfoundland was a major highlight in each of our lives. It tugged at our emotions at every turn.The people of Newfoundland, especially those of genetic connection, couldn't do enough for us. It was really like coming home, but then, that has always been the nature of Newfoundland courtesy,even to non-Newfoundlanders. It was reassuring to see that the Newfoundland charm has transcended time.It has endured so many changes since Confederation in 1949.My brother and I, eternally, will be Newfoundlanders and hope to go down home more often in the years to come.5.	The FraudFlushed with excitement, Kate stepped into the spatial vestibule and was immediately dazzled by the scene before her. The inlaid marble floor paved the way to a circular staircase rising three levels above her.In a fountain in the center of the entryway stood a bronze dolphin balancing on its tail,its snout pointed to the lofty domed, stained glass skylight forty feet above. A massive chandelier,luminous in the bright sunlight,cast rainbow fairies dancing through the pink, green, and gold floral patterns of the floor and around the snowy white walls.Before she could fully appreciate the beauty of the intricate plaster work decorating the edges of the shallow niches installed in the walls to frame the numerous paintings, or, indeed, to appreciate the canvases themselves, her host, Victor Stone, approached.Small by North American standards,he was perfectly proportioned.Slightly balding at the forehead,his silver hair curved onto the collar of his pale blue shirt at the nape of his neck.Laughing blue eyes startled her with their clarity. A straight, aristocratic nose rose to meet his slightly arched brows.His carefully manicured hands bore a single gold pinkie ring.He held out his hand to take hers.��Thank you so much for coming, Kate. I am glad you could make it,�� he said cheerfully.She had never met this charming little man before and knew him by reputation only.Among his contemporaries, he was known as a shrewd entrepreneur, able to diagnose at a glance,the prospects of those seeking his backing. She was anxious to learn why he had invited her to come to meet him at his home.��Thanks for asking me.Nice place you have here.��She felt stupid saying something so absurd, but she was,at that moment, stumped.Her ego wouldn't let her admit she'd never in her whole life, been so impressed by a foyer. She hoped that he would realize she'd had little experience with the elite, take pity on her, and show her around.��Would you like to see more of the house?�� he asked, politely.��Would I? You bet!�� She was happy he gave no indication that he thought she was not in his bracket.She left her briefcase on the settee near the door and followed him through the foyer to a stairway to a stairway leading to a lower level of the house.They began the tour in the wine cellar.A heavy,double thick door opened to reveal row upon row of gleaming glass bottles of vintage wines, all lying on their sides, cradled by the solid oak racks. The steady hum of machinery broke the silence of the insulated room.Victor explained that it was necessary to control the ventilation, temperature and humidity of the cellar to achieve optimum conditions for conserving the flavors of the expensive wines.The small but luxurious audio-visual theater was adjacent to the wine cellar. Leather upholstered reclining chairs were casually arrayed about the room, all with an unimpaired view of the retractable screen.The stereo, silent at that moment, was state of the art, with speakers tactically installed for maximizing sound effects. Black walnut wood paneling and a baffled ceiling averted the possibility of overly loud entertainment disturbing others in the mansion.Sliding glass doors led from the lowest level of the living area to the enclosed kidney shaped swimming pool.Turquoise and white ceramic tiles outlined with gold covered the deck area.Pillars of quartz topped with milk glass spheres provided illumination should anyone choose to swim after dark.A changing booth was discretely hidden behind a screen of ornamental floor plants and cascading vines.Here, too,a baffled ceiling prevented the hollow resonance of the pool room from disturbing others.At the moment, the games room was arranged for gambling.An authentic roulette wheel,a craps table for dice,and various card tables were set up for a benefit evening that was being held the following night.Checkers, chess and other board games augmented the games of chance.Comfortable furniture and soft lighting lent a romantic atmosphere to the terrace garden. Kate had noticed earlier that Victor had a slight limp.As they progressed on their tour, she realized he was quite lame on the right side and needed to rest.They sat to chat for a few minutes.��How much do you know about me, Kate?�� he asked.��Only what I've read.And what I have discerned in the past half hour. I think you are a man who has made your home into a diversion from the real world. Your taste is implicit, subtle. Everything I have seen has been chosen with a keen eye, not to overwhelm, but to invite. I think you choose things for their intrinsic value, things that are esthetically pleasing to you. I don't think there could be an imitation or a fake item in this whole place. You love your home and enjoy sharing it with others. Am I right?����You are perceptive! Come.Let��s go to the sitting room and have a cocktail.�� He led the way back into the library with its mahogany shelves filled with leather bound matched sets of first editions and volumes of encyclopedia.On a sturdy table under a reading lamp an illuminated manuscript with gold metallic page edging was lying open to display its vibrant art. Kate felt compelled to mention this beautiful piece. He said an obscure monk during the Renaissance had copied and illustrated the Book of Revelations.It had been quite shabby when it first came into his possession but he had it restored and planned to donate it to a museum.The door to a powder room stood ajar. Inside Kate noticed, again, the careful attention to detail manifest in the rest of the house. The doorknob was hand painted porcelain.The ivory colored fixtures were shell-shaped and gold-trimmed.A large bowl of sweetly scented flowers was centered on the vanity.Next to the flowers sat a piece of hand-carved fossilized ebony.Kate was stunned by the size of the spacious sitting room.Several groupings of furniture lent themselves to seating as few as two guests or as many as ten. Here, too, ornamental plasterwork decorated the walls and ceilings. The raspberry colored velvet upholstery covering the couches and chairs complemented the pale green oriental carpets and lightly textured draperies.The gold-colored lamps with their creamy white shades, the paintings in their ornate alcoves, and the open fireplace with family pictures on the mantel, gave Kate an overwhelming feeling of comfort and peace.She relished the novelty and thrill of having been summoned to this prestigious man's home.The sheer beauty of the place far surpassed her expectations.However, she was becoming suspicious about the reason for this visit.Now that she had received an orientation to his home,and notwithstanding her first impressions of the man, she was anxious to learn why she was here.What could a mere reporter do for this rich, influential man?He began to speak soberly, contradicting his earlier spontaneity.��I will tell you a story you may have difficulty believing,��he said, softly.��I was not born into this lifestyle.It is ironic that there is such a discrepancy between what I was and what I am.My father left the United States when I was about two years old. He ran a junk store in the slums of Winnipeg when I was a kid. He was a vulgar man but he knew how to fool people into thinking they were buying something rare or valuable. It was under his tutelag that I learned to be a fraud.��I decided at an early age that if there was a shortcut to success,I could bypass the complications of getting there by the conventional methods. I was like a hurricane, rushing forward without consideration for the rules.If it's any consolation,I didn't intentionally harm anyone in the process. I was able to stay within the parameters of the law, but just barely.I bought and sold used furniture before going into the antique business.When I bought, I always paid a fraction of the potential worth of the goods.When I sold, I always made a profit. I was able to upgrade my stock with almost every transaction. In time,I had a warehouse full of merchandise.I didn't flatter myself by thinking I hadn't muddied the waters a bit.I knew I had probably stepped on a few toes, but I was on a roll. I had the momentum and rejoiced in my success.As long as the money kept coming in, anything was permissible.One day, I received a visit from a rather important patron of the arts. He had an interesting proposition for me.He held the patent and trademark for the prototype of an innovative way to determine the age of a painting using ultraviolet light. He would sell them to me for the nominal fee of a nickel if I would reciprocate by doing him a favor.I was to include one of his personal paintings in my next shipment of antiques going to New York.At first, I thought he was mocking me, but he gave me his oath that he just wanted to ensure the painting would arrive at its destination safely, and, because it would be a part of an antique shipment, it would be exempt from import duty.It was a provocative offer, and even though I remained skeptical, I agreed.A few days later, a crated painting arrived and was added to my goods ready for delivery to New York. I had always subscribed to the theory that if something appeared to be too good to be true, it probably was.However, my greed prevailed and the painting was on its way.I was unaware at the time that my fortunes were about to go into a downward spiral. My benefactor, it turned out, was a man with a grudge against me. Irrespective of the fact that I felt a deal we had made years before had been fair, he felt I had cheated him. I was about to be the recipient of his wrath.When my agent in New York went to customs to retrieve the shipment, he was greeted by a squad of police waiting to detain him on charges of smuggling cocaine. It appeared there was a bit of a discrepancy between what I was told was in the crate and the actual contents. The drugs were in a hidden compartment in the crate.I admit it was naive of me to believe I had no enemies, but I didn't know anyone would go to this degree to prove how much he despised me.Hitherto, I had gone through life thinking that when two people agreed to a deal, if one of them got the better of the other, it was fair, because they did agree. Now I was learning that if you take advantage of some people, even with their permission, you aggravate them to seek revenge. I can't refute my recklessness.Almost seven years have elapsed since that time. My agent took responsibility for the crime and went to jail for five years. I felt guilty as hell, but I continued to pay him by sending the money to his family. I even withheld extra in a bonus account to give to him when he was released. I also gave up my business and began to help others start their businesses.In time, the guilt I felt subsided. I put my energies into stepping into the breach to help those less fortunate than I. To my amazement, my luck started to fluctuate upward and I flourished. All you see here today, I have accumulated since that time.Now, it seems, my enemy has decided to reclaim his power over me. He has reported the crime and the erroneous imprisonment of my agent and named me as the person responsible for the offence. I had never changed my citizenship, so the F.B.I. wants me deported so they can prosecute me in New York.I hope I can induce you, through your column, to tell my story. Next week I have to appear before a magistrate for the preliminary hearing. If I'm not mistaken, public pressure might enable me to avoid deportation at least. I am more likely to get a fair trial here than there. My record as a good citizen may offset the perception that I may be a criminal.What do you think? Will you help?Kate had listened to this synopsis in silence but her outrage was building.While his story seemed plausible, this plea for her assistance didn't quite fit. With his financial resources, he could hire the best legal team in the country. She realized she had to detach herself from her first impressions and extract fact from fiction. Why didn't she believe him? Suddenly, it came to her. Exposition of this version of Victor's tale would not only gain him public sympathy, it would invalidate any testimony against him.Nothing could constrain her when she realized she had literally been taken in by his story.��If you were innocent, why weren't you the defendant? If you were innocent all those years ago, why did your agent go to prison for you? Why did it take so long for your enemy to turn you in? The statute of limitations for that offence has expired. I believe this has been a pathetic attempt to get me to mediate your case in the press. I think you have always been an integral player in the criminal world and your past has caught up with you. My cardinal sin was allowing myself to be reeled in by your tales of what a model citizen you are.��Kate could feel herself getting dizzy and light-headed, surprised by the audacity she had, talking to anyone in that manner. Before she lost complete control, she would have to get out of there. She stood, turned, and marched toward the door. As she began to open the front door, she looked back. Victor stood beside his chair, pale and shaken. ��You admitted you were a fraud in your youth. You are still a fraud! I will write your story...my version! My guess is that the eventual verdict will be��guilty��!��6.	The PastureNight settled, thick with the acrid odors of gunpowder and blood.No moon meant firing at muzzle flashes, an inexact method by which to combat one's foe, but the enemy had no advantage either. With artillery fire blanketing the field of battle, Jack had no opportunity to go to Mike's aid.He poked his head over the rim of the trench to see if he could spot Mike's corpse. He knew he was dead. He had heard his scream of pain when he was hit. His agonized moans had grown weaker and less frequent and finally ceased about ten minutes ago.The regiment had been under heavy bombardment for two days,without respite. He had been too late to stop Mike as he propelled himself out of the foxhole and staggered as he hit the muddy terrain.In hindsight, he should have seen it coming. Mike had started to break yesterday. He was becoming bizarre, talking about his patriotic duty to expel the enemy from these shores. Paradoxically, just before he hopped over the edge of the trench he scorned the day he had heeded the call to enlist.It pained him to realize that his one friend in this ungodly war had betrayed him by dying. Soldiers don't often make friends with one another, knowing they might die. He and Mike were different. They had known each other since they were children.Mike was the best man when Jack and Lily walked down the aisle just a week before they left the dock and crossed the channel to engage the enemy.Clouds tumbled and overlapped one another as the wind began to freshen. It was getting colder now. The prospect of another night of rain, or perhaps even snow, made Jack quiver with dread.Blood tinged water was beginning to crust over with ice. He could feel his toes and fingers stiffen as the temperature dropped. Maybe Mike was better off than he. At least the cold wouldn't bother him any more.Suddenly, comets of light began to streak across the night sky. They were using flares! The increased tempo of cannon fire coming from the left flank, shattering the earth around them,could only mean the enemy had sensed their weakness, and was coming in for the kill. They were heading straight for the underbelly!Jack's rifle misfired.The whole corps had been issued new guns a few days before this campaign had started. It wasn't long before they discovered that the alloy used in the barrels couldn't endure prolonged firing, causing the shell casings to adhere in the bore. How could he repel the enemy without a weapon?Jack felt a stab of pain in his right thigh. The ground around him ruptured.Jerking from side to side, he tried to dodge falling rocks and the clods of dirt raining down upon him. He slumped into a prone posture as he felt himself shoved from behind by an unknown force that felt as if it might have been a racing locomotive.The last thing he heard, before his world was overturned, was a chorus of screams.��Am I dead? Where am I? Where is everybody?�� Cognitively, Jack realized he was still functioning physiologically so that meant he was still alive, but for how long? He couldn't move.Maybe the impact had fractured his spine and he was paralyzed. He tried��analytically��to assess the damage incurred by moving his limbs, one by one, in a clockwise direction, starting with his right arm. Everything appeared able to be mobilized but for some reason he couldn't get up off the ground. Everything went black again.Jack led his horse by the reins as they stepped onto the overpass bridging the gap between the plateaus. In the distance, he could see a twelve point buck grazing in the pasture, silhouetted against the waning sunset.Out of nowhere, a bull came charging across the meadow toward him.He tried to run but his feet were pegged to the bridge.Drifting in and out of consciousness, Jack tried to make sense of what had happened to him. He seemed to be in a cavity under the ground. The earth was compacted on his legs but he thought he might be able to rotate his body enough to make himself a little more comfortable.Was that a shaft of light he could see through the groove between the fingers of his left hand covering his eyes? He groped to clear a tiny bit more space for himself. The shutters of his consciousness closed again.The galaxy was being probed by lunar modules shuttling between Earth and the other planets. As a member of a federation of geologists, Jack and his team had to follow the seam of ore to its source, a pasture on a distant asteroid.Once again, Jack regained lucidity. ��Wow,�� he thought, ��that was like a bad paperback novel about astronomy!�� He sniffed the air.It was foul with the smell of death but qualitatively able to sustain life.Why was it so quiet? Was he deaf? Was the battle over? Was everyone dead? The weight on his legs was becoming oppressive.Lily lay back in the soft, green grass of the pasture.White daisies, golden brown-eyed Susans, prickly blue viper's bugloss, and frilly Queen Anne's lace surrounded her. She beckoned to him from what seemed like miles away. He hiked through the grass calling her name. She began to stroll away from him into the distance. He had to reach her! He loved her so!If they couldn't marry, he would make her his mistress! Nothing could extinguish the flame of his love! He would cling to that until his dying day.Lying stationary was taking its toll on Jack's circulation. His feet and hands were numb. Something was tickling his nose.He managed to tilt away from the irritant, whatever it was. He was so thirsty! He tried to lubricate his lips with saliva but had none. His bladder felt like a separate entity that would overflow. He could stall the urge to void no longer and allowed the urine to flow out of him.What did it matter now?He was as good as dead anyway.The fort stood in the center of the pasture.A moat filled with sharks protected its walls from any possible intruders. Jack pedaled his bicycle as fast as he could. The sharks whipped back and forth so quickly they created foam on the surface of the water. He had to cross the drawbridge before it was raised, segregating him from his regiment and his pregnant wife, Lily. She saw him approaching and skipped onto the bridge to greet him.The bridge was rising. The sharks were in frenzy! He rode as if the hounds of hell were after him. He had to reach her!His right arm was wedged against a rock. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't wrench it free. This was getting tiresome. He felt a stitch in his right side. That's all he needed now to die from a ruptured appendix!He had wriggled enough to increase the size of the slot in which he was trapped. Were those voices he was hearing? He wasn't deaf!When he fought his way to the surface of consciousness once again, he was being carried on a litter over the inverted battlefield. Bodies were strewn everywhere. The stretcher bearers stumbled over the rough ground but maintained control of their human cargo as they made their way to the field hospital.The fuse leading to the dynamite in the stern of the oil tanker burned so rapidly that Jack knew the ship would explode before he could reach the hatch to extinguish the flame. The olive green ship was almost within his reach when it blew up.He felt as if he were on a grill. His face was aflame. His body felt as if the skin had been ripped from it.He wanted to die before the pain grew worse.His forehead felt cool.He opened his eyes slowly, painfully. A white-clad nurse sponged his face gently.As she became aware of his gaze, she stopped her ministrations and offered him a sip of water.��Take it easy,�� she whispered.��You mustn't drink too quickly. Too much, too fast will give you nasty cramps.��Jack was aware of bandages on his muscular arms and casts on both legs. Intravenous tubing carried a clear fluid into his veins. Consciousness was still transient. Dreams of a strange pasture mingled with reality and continued to haunt his sleep. He understood he was on a hospital ward, but where? And how did he get here?The pretty young nurse was back.��We cabled your wife. She knows you were injured but are on the mend.����How did they find me?�� Jack asked.��A patrol looking for survivors found you buried in the the foxhole. You were calling ��Lily!��They started digging and there you were. You were stabilized at the field hospital before they could bring you here.We scrubbed you up and started to you with I.V. therapy.You were very dehydrated and suffering from urinary retentionand renal failure. Your kidneys may never function normally again. The good news is that you survived,�� she explained. A stray strand of hair fell across Jack's cheek hiding the tears that crept from his eyes. He was grateful to have his life back. He silently saluted his friend. Mike hadn't been so lucky.The cable from Lily arrived the next day.��We have a son stop Born 05 Dec. stop Healthy stop Named him Michael stop I love you. Lily stop P.S. Dad bought the pasture and deeded it to Michael.��7.	The DecisionDr. Sam said to me: ��I don't know how to say this, except to come right out with it, Miriam. The tests we did last week show that there are abnormalities with the fetus. I recommend you consider an abortion.��I sat, hands folded together in my lap, numbed by his words. The world around me disappeared as I strove to absorb the dreadful news Dr. Sam was giving me. His voice came to me as if spoken in a tunnel, hollow and echoing. Could this be true? The baby inside me, the miracle created by love, wasn't perfect!��Your baby has a condition known as Down's Syndrome. The problems you will face if you don't terminate this pregnancy could be overwhelming, especially now that Paul is no longer with you.��Here I was, thirty nine years old, pregnant for the first time, and my doctor, my trusted friend, was telling me I should kill this innocent life in my womb. I knew I had to respond but words escaped me.Finally, I was able to speak. ��I need some time to consider my options.With all that has happened in the past month and a half, I don't want to do anything without knowing all I can about this.����You don't have long, Miriam. You are eleven weeks along and it's dangerous to perform an abortion after twelve weeks, try not to prolong your decision.����It's too much for me to get my head around right now. I need to think. I promise I��ll get back to you in a day or so.�� I left the office in a daze. What was I going to do? Where would I begin? Who,besides Dr. Sam, would be able to advise me? My parents were on the other side of the world, teaching in China. I felt that if I could talk to Mom, held in her comforting arms, she would give me some of her wisdom.If I could be face-to-face with Dad, he would give me strength.They were all I had left in my world.My husband, Paul, had been killed in a traffic accident six weeks ago.Mom and Dad had gone back to China a week after the funeral,when they thought I was able to cope with my loss. There was nowhere to turn.I had to face reality.This was a decision I would make on my own. I needed to gather all the information I could about Down's syndrome. I wasted no time. I went to the library to begin my research. The steps to the future were in my hands.The first medical journal I chose explained the causes of Down's syndrome. Normally, each egg and sperm cell contains 23 chromosomes, and, when they unite, 23 pairs or 46 in total.Occasionally, an accident occurs when the egg or sperm cell is forming, creating an extra chromosome number 21. This extra chromosome results in the features of Down's syndrome. In the past, this disorder was called ��Mongolism�� because of the facial characteristics including slanted eyes and a small, flattened nasal bridge.It is a commongenetic birth defect affecting about one in 800 to 1000 births when the mother is 30 years of age. The odds of my having a Down syndrome increased to one in 100 because I was in my fortieth year.There is no cure for this disorder. Neither is there any prevention. My child would be developmentally and physically retarded to a greater or lesser degree. She could have numerous health problems.It was unlikely she would ever marry and her having children was out of the question. Her life expectancy could be as little as 55 years.Paul and I had been married for ten years and had always regretted the fact that I had been unable to conceive.After he died, I attributed my nausea, vomiting and lethargy to my grief, never suspecting that I might be pregnant. Poor Paul would never know that we would have a child together.This thought alone was what made me realize that I wouldn't be able to have an abortion, no matter what obstacles might be ahead of us.I waited a day before calling Dr. Sam to inform him of my decision. I had to be sure!��Miriam, I think I know why you want to go through with this pregnancy, but are you aware of the risks?����I know my baby will be different. I know she may be mentally and physically retarded.She may have developmental difficulties and problems with social acceptance.I do recognize that I am going to have to amend almost every facet of my life.I am prepared to do that. This is my final gift from Paul and I am determined to go through with this!����I thought you would feel that way. You have my utmost admiration and support. I will follow your pregnancy carefully but I want you to see a specialist in birth defects. I will refer you to Dr. Brown and would like you to make an appointment with her as soon as possible,�� he said.I knew then that I had made the right choice.My pregnancy was not without its hardships, from morning sickness to swollen ankles, but I had no doubts about the decision I had made.My parents, when I told them what was going on with me, expressed their concerns but also their confidence in my decision and assured me they would be there when I delivered my baby.Paula was born on a bright,cloudless, warm Tuesday morning in May.I was prepared to see a red, wrinkled, squalling infant.Instead, I saw very little.Because of the risks involved,Paula was delivered by Caesarian section.The doctors and nurses rushed her into an incubatorto assess her before I caught a glimpse of her.I could see my parents on the other side of the operating room window, questions in their eyes.What was going on?The nurses kept me comfortable and tried to alleviate my fears but half an hour passed before our questions were answered.My daughter had a severe heart defect.It could be corrected through surgery but not until she gained a little weight and strength.I understood in that moment that my life had changed forever.I demanded to see her immediately,and as soon as I did,I fell in love. This most precious of all gifts was going to survive the obstacles ahead of her with my help.I knew in an instant that all my strength,love, and monetary resources were at her command. Nothing she wanted,needed, or even dreamed of, would ever be denied.The heart surgery to correct a flawed valve was a resounding success.Fortunately, the common defects occurring in a majority of Down's syndrome children were absent in Paula. She has no intestinal malformations, hearing impairment, or severe visual problems.We are truly blessed.My parents adore this exceptional grandchild.Their expertise in teaching, nurturing,and parenting has been so welcome.I always knew they were there for me; now they are there for us.I am aware of the sympathetic looks from strangers who don't know or understand the disorder afflicting my child. Their pity, for what they ascertain as my plight, is misplaced but understandable.I am sure that I, too,felt sorry for parents of what I thought of as imperfect children.Paula is a delightful child.Her physical defects are apparent; there is no doubt she is different from other children.However, she goes to school with other children her age; she takes longer to learn things and has to work harder,but she is achieving all the milestones of growing children.Raising her is a challenge,as is the raising of any child.It isn't easy and it won't get easier.As she grows and develops,there will be questions to answer,hurdles to cross, and goals to reach. Paula is different. She is aware that she is. It doesn't dismay her. She greets each day with a smile on her lips and a sparkle in her eye.Do I ever have doubts about my decision? No! My only regret is that Paul isn't here to share my joy in our wonderful daughter.8.	Chinese-American Relations: A History(��)The Nineteenth Century to World War��The Nineteenth CenturyIn the 19th century, the United States was a relative newcomer to the area of international affairs. Relations with China really began, not so subtly, in the 19th century with its discriminatory immigration policy against China.The Gold Rush of 1849 in California, the building of railroads, and the American industrial revolution of the second half of the 19th century, attracted many Chinese immigrants with dreams of the good life in America.At that time, it was perceived by most of the world, that America was the land of opportunity, success, and wealth.As the Chinese population in the United States grew in size, pressures to limit the number of these coming into the United States became strong.Laws, such as placing a police tax on Chinese people in California in 1862 and The Chinese Exclusion Act passed in 1882, officially testified to blatant discrimination against Chinese people.The latter felt forced to congregate in areas of big cities, such as San Francisco, New York, and Boston. Chinatown soon became part of American urban vocabulary.It seemed that the timid Chinese were susceptible to being pushed around. It appeared that Chinese and other Oriental immigrants were not welcome with open arms, but were welcome only when hard labour was needed to do the toughest jobs, especially in railroad construction and in the new industries that were fast developing at the time.It would be well into the 20th century before such discriminatory laws would be suspended.The Early Twentieth Century During the second half of the 19th century, the United States was preoccupied with a civil war and a post civil war industrial revolution.American foreign policy with China did not really take form until 1899 and 1900.By the turn of the century, the United States was ascending as a major player in international affairs, especially in the western hemisphere. American foreign policy, at the time, focused mostly on Latin America.However, in 1899, the Americans saw economic opportunities in an already politically suppressed China.For decades, European countries had been reaping the economic benefits by exploiting of the country's resources and markets while claiming chunks of territory as their own. It had become a closed club of the countries already established there.The United States, fearing that China was about to officially partitioned, wanted access to those lucrative assets as well. American Secretary of State, John Hay, perhaps using some Big Stick and gunboat tactics, popular American strategies at the time, was well positioned to get the established foreign nations in China to conform to an agreement called the Open Door policy for China.This benchmark intervention by the United States, conferred on all countries, equal and impartial trade with all parts of China, while preserving the territorial and administrative integrity of the country.The American approach did little to respect China's customary opposition to foreign intrusion. To China, the United States was only one more country to bully it, to exploit its resources and sovereignty and, further, to deny it of its autonomy, integrity, and dignity. This collective foreign presence,boosted by American interests, diffused any hope for China to break the chains of humiliating foreign occupation.The Chinese were virtually captives or prisoners in their own country.The United States did not deviate far from this economic policy toward China, until the communist take over in 1949.One could only imagine how the Chinese must have felt at the turn of the century.Could any American imagine a scenario of the shoe being on the other foot (putting themselves in the place of the Chinese)?How would Americans have felt if Chinese gunboats patrolled the Mississippi River up to St. Louis, a major city in the heart of America?What if the Chinese could come and go anywhere in the United States, being completely immune to all American laws. Could Americans accept Chinatown in Boston of San Francisco being under Chinese law, and displaying signs with such captions as��No Americans or dogs allowed��?What if Manhattan Island and California were annexed by China? Would Americans tolerate their own officials being in collusion with, and being bribed by Chinese authorities, to let all of above to take place? One would think not.Is it any wonder that imperialism had become such an abominable term to the Chinese people?The Chinese have made some conscientious attempts to fight back, in efforts to defy foreign presence in China, but without much support during the slack reign of the Qing Emperor and the Dowager Empress.The Imperial family, for so long, had been extremely self��indulgent. It paid little attention to the realities of what was happening inside China. For so long, the nation's policies revolved around the whims of the Imperial Family.With reliance on its own resources, a secret society, called the Order of Literary Patriotic Harmonious Fists, made one last desperate attempt at revenge, to rid the country of foreigners.In 1900, these Boxers as they were called, stubbornly engaged the foreign powers in conflict. The former tore up railway tracks, attacked Chinese Christians, besieged foreign delegations, and eventually slaughtered over three hundred foreigners. The Americans collaborated with the Japanese, consolidated forces and easily overwhelmed the Boxers.The latter crumbled under the pressure of foreign superiority and its own deficiencies in equipment and organization. The victors placed severe controls on the crippled Chinese Government and imposed heavy indemnities of billions of dollars.The fact that the foreigners were interested, only in protecting their own interests, was abundantly clear.Aside from discriminatory immigration policy against Chinese, the U.S. had no official direct political or diplomatic relations with China until the Second World War.The United States took on a much cherished isolationist approach to world affairs following the First World War, after having established itself as a major world power.The United States did not even become a representative of the League of Nations, essentially the creation of its own then President, Woodrow Wilson. This organization was set up in 1919 to curb international conflict, which could, potentially, throw the world into a war again.The absence of this powerful nation was one of the major weaknesses of this organization and, consequently, a possible factor that actually facilitated the resumption of world conflict in 1939.The Second World War During the Second World War, the United States and China were allies against the common enemy, Japan.A coalition of the United States, British Commonwealth countries, and other allies dispatched supplies and other support to China by way of the Burma Road and by air over the hump (mountains), to close in on Japan from the rear. When war broke out in 1939, China was experiencing a civil war, the Nationalists versus the Communists.This civil war was put on hold while both the Nationalists and Communists joined forces to converge on Japan, which had, intermittently, hovered over China as a menace, or as an imperialist thorn in its side, for a good century before the war.The war brought the United States out of its splendid official isolation. Once the war was over, turbulent times continued to stalk China. The civil war picked up where it left off.The Americans lent its moral support to the Nationalists in their struggle against the Communists,whereby the United States began to formulate its Cold War policy of ��Containment�� (Containing the spread of Communism).9.	Chinese-American Relations: A History(��)The Cold War to the PresentThe Cold WarAfter the war, a new war of international tension, intrigue and political posturing, called the Cold War, forced the U.S. to scrap any thoughts of the false comforts of official isolation. It joined the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF),and the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). It was determined to play a major, if not dominant role, in post war international affairs. The world was the stage for intense rivalry between the Communists, on one side, and democratic Capitalists on the other. It fostered close scrutiny of each other, as well as a brisk interchange of often fabricated and distorted propaganda between the polarized sides. It injected the fear that if one side blinked, a nuclear war would be triggered.The world, seemingly, was always on the verge of warfare. This environment placed the United States and China on opposite sides once the Communists took power in China in 1949. This constant friction jeopardized chances for meaningful political interaction and intercourse. This atmosphere of distrust and fear left little incentive for the different sides to talk seriously. By the end of the Second World War, or during the last year or two of the war, the world stage was being set for the Cold War. President Truman's attitude toward China hardened.American policy was explicit that only one China, Nationalist China led by Chiang Kai��shek, on the island of Taiwan, was the official China.The Americans made it abundantly clear, that Mao Tsetung's Communist Regime, on mainland China, would not occupy China's permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council.The outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula brought about an abrupt change of focus in American foreign policy. The new American strategy was to militarily isolate or alienate China in Asia. To accomplish this, the United States established bases in East Asia and mutual defense treaties in East Asia. Treaties were negotiated with Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. American President Eisenhower later expanded these to include South Korea, Pakistan, and Thailand. To cap off this anti��China strategy, the US strengthened ties with Taiwan or Nationalist China, with which the former had official diplomatic ties.In the 1950s, American power and credibility deteriorated somewhat in the Cold War. Its own people, who began to oppose McCarthyism and the blunt anti-communist policies of John Foster Dulles, the American Secretary of State in the Eisenhower Administration, helped to undermined national prestige.In 1953, Josef Stalin, the Soviet leader, died. These events helped to bring about a shift in direction in American foreign policy. The United States began to look more to Asian events as major threats to America's national security. The Iron Curtain was firmly established in Europe, and NATO forces provided secure protection on the western side of the curtain. For the time being, things looked fairly stable in Europe.In the East, because of the end of the Korean War and the exodus of the French from Indo-China, things were not as stable. The American political elite contended that the foremost problem was the vacuum left by the French withdrawal from Indo-China.To officials in the United States, this void must not be filled by another communist regime. The realization of objectives of the domino theory (the essence of which was, that if not checked, countries in an given area will all gradually fall to communist rule) could not be allowed to perpetuate. The Chinese Revolution had established a communist regime in the most populous country in the world, and the tensions between North and South Korea were not going to go away overnight.Success of the domino theory looked more likely in Asia than in Europe. The United States felt that it needed to concentrate its energies and resources in Asia. American policies, during the 1960s and early 1970s, essentially were to prevent communist takeovers in Asia, in particular, particularly in South Vietnam and Taiwan. American policy was to contain communism where it already existed, while simultaneously coexisting peacefully with its cold war communist rivals.Military expenditures increased as defense budgets went sky high with democratic and communist bureaucracies building huge arsenals or inventories of high velocity, even supersonic destructive nuclear weapons, in a very fragile polarized world.Even China tested a thermal nuclear weapon in the early 60s. Thawing of the Cold War��the 1970's to 2001 American Cold War policy ensued until the early 1970's, when some major changes in thinking were inaugurated. Communist China's entry to the United Nations was a setback for the United States. The Vietnam War was not going well.In the early 70s, American President Nixon,the arch��conservative and anti-communist president, up to that point, was preparing to visit China and the Soviet Union. Why would an American president visit these enemies? The Americans came to the realization that the development of good relations with its counterparts in the communist world was necessary. A forthcoming, more pragmatic approach to foreign policy with China was to be a departure from the adverse ideological approach.The United States had lost solid backing from traditional supporters, as illustrated by Communist China's entry into the United Nations.The question as to whether Nationalist China or the People's Republic of China should hold China's permanent Security Council seat,was a topic of much discussion and debate for years.For many countries, the idea of ignoring one third of the world's population at the UN was difficult to rationalize. This debate ensued until 1971,when the People��s Republic of China finally displaced Nationalist China at the United Nations, including the permanent seat, originally held by Nationalist China in the Security Council. A baffled United States could no longer persuade norintimidate the majority of the countries in the UN General Assembly to keep Communist China out of the UN.The United States had little choice but to eventually extend official recognition to the People��s Republic of China.The war-weary American people were no longer supporting the war in Vietnam and no longer eagerly supporting traditional foreign policy.A major scandal(Watergate), that would rock the Nixon Administration to the resultant resignation of the president, was about to be disclosed. Practical solutions were needed for practical problems. Peaceful coexistence meant finding some common ground on which to activate international trust and cooperation. Nixon's consecutive predecessors, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson would have rolled over in their graves if they could have seen these changes. These changes would have appeared alien, contradictory or even contrived, to them and their contemporaries.Presidents Ford, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton saw the need to keep communication channels open with China.Americans finally realized that they could no longer keep down a sleeping giant. No longer a Paper Tiger, China was a reality, and was entitled to an important place in world decision��making http://venues.In the 1980's following the Cultural Revolution and the death of Mao Tsetung, China's outlook on the world changed dramatically. Deng Xiaopeng's reforms were to bring China closer to being a major world partner in international trade and the development of world markets. This was capped with its admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in December 2001.China has been most willing to comply with all of the regulations of the WTO. Americans have only half-heartedly opposed China's entry, by unfairly using ��human rights��as a distraction to perhaps disguise other international pressures.However, the United States, for a couple of decades, already had major, politically discreet, vested economic interests in China that it could not afford to deny or jeopardize. In 1998, China signed a Permanent Normal Trading Relations agreement with the United States, the prelude to the former's entry into the WTO. President Clinton, who visited China in 1998, had essentially paid lip service to Congressional pressure to push the human rights issues with China. Except for the occasional irritating crisis in recent years, such as the spy plane incident off the island of Hainan in April 2001, Sino-American relations have been cordial but cautious. The consensus seems to be,that China's destiny as a major international force in the 21th century, seems reasonably assured.10.	A Solitary QuestFrom my suite of rooms atop the Holiday Inn I surveyed the narrow alleys below me.Only yesterday had I left my frantic North American life behind, to avail myself of an opportunity to travel to China. I wished to spend time researching material for my thesis pertaining to Eastern religions.The hotel was in close proximity to the heart of the old downtown.Innumerable activities were happening below me. People surged along the street sometimes stopping to bargain with street vendors. Cucumbers, tomatoes, apples, oranges and grapes were heaped on hand carts. The variety of fruit available provided a virtual feast for the eyes.Deliverymen jogged along pulling enormous loads of cardboard. To a Westerner's eyes cars merged unbelievably without incident. It appeared to be a dubious process to negotiate the traffic and even cross the street.However, rather than lounging indoors, I decided to venture outside to explore the colorful world below. I was interested in locating a church to attend, as today was Sunday.On the street I made tentative enquiries about locating a Christian chapel. At times the congestion of people hampered my progress. Stares from passers-by made me feel conspicuous. The weather was hot and humid and there was some possibility of a typhoon reaching the city later in the day.After several false leads I found myself standing in front of a very old Christian Church, established by missionaries during the last dynasty and at the beginning of the last century.With the onset of a light sprinkle, I made a hasty retreat to shelter in the doorway of the church. The familiar refrain of well-known hymns rang out within the church. I felt drawn inside to join the fellowship in a foreign land. Even though our languages differed, my gracious hosts nonetheless, made room for me, and made me feel welcome.Sitting in this old church in China led me to contemplate about the lives of men and their spouses who lived decades ago, when they traveled to this distant land in the Eastern Hemisphere.Many of these Christian ministers and laymen left their comfortable churches, even cathedrals to preach their ideology to foreigners.They established small chapels where people could join in Christian fellowship and where some Chinese people accepted conversion to a new faith.They came to a land where the predominate faith was Buddhism. Even though their words were eloquent the message at times must have seemed formidable and gloomy. Even the foreigners'clothing styles would have appeared queer.During this colonial time period missionaries emigrated to all areas of China, visiting small villages, distributing Bibles, offering divine salvation and preaching the word of God.A unanimous decision was made by many faiths to attempt to enrich the lives of others and to present the eloquent message of Christianity.Some missionaries worked in the medical field as doctors, surgeons, nurses and dentists.Agriculture specialists helped the farmers elevate their crop performance to provide better nutrition for the people. Finally there were teachers who ran the mission schools.All had to be very versatile at their work. These people proved to be an inspiration for others to follow in their footsteps. Earnings from all these areas would go back into further mission work to fulfill their mandate.In retrospect, my fascination with this historical era may have been kindled in childhood.While visiting my grandparent's home every Thanksgiving, I was allowed to examine the fascinating ornaments from the Orient. There were delicate elephant sculptures carved from ivory, lacy sandalwood fans and an imposing brass Buddha.Best of all, I was allowed to don an exquisite silk embroidered jacket and play with a blue and tan parasol which was adorned with sprays of plum blossoms and tiny buds. It was then I was introduced to an exotic new world.Maybe this too, is partly what lured me to this country.Under a new regime in China, government statesmen questioned what justification these foreign ministers had in their country.Subsequently, the morality of the instruction was questioned. The pendulum swung the other way and church people would no longer be welcome to impart their message.A plea to reconsider the decision was unsuccessful. Diplomats also would be required to leave the country. It would be a long time before visas would be issued to foreign people, to again live in China.And so here I am! The clearance for my visitor's visa had been administered swiftly. My surroundings aroused in me a sense of heritage.Today, sitting here pondering, allowed me to be a participant rather than just a spectator in a new chapter of China's history.11.	Acting Today for TomorrowProtecting the natural environment, the ecology of a country, is a major concern for every country these days.It is mandatory not to minimize the importance of clean air, clean water, and clean land. It is a sad commentary on today's society that industries have been permitted to contaminate our natural surroundings.A dreadful discrepancy exists between the importance placed on economic development and the protection of the environment's heritage. If allowed to proceed unchecked, the public will eventually inherit a major catastrophe.Even countries who practice strict pollution control measures may still be affected by countries adjacent to or adjoining them,when air pollution permeates the air.It is important for media coverage to compile accurate data to enable the public to boycott increased irresponsible industrialization.To disguise the people's safety calling it progress will eventually lead to many casualties.Canada has a land and water mass of 9 970 610 km2, with a population of 30 million people.This is a country where the ratio of people compared to the mass of the land is very low.Can you conceive that in such a gigantic land that a garbage problem exists? I wish that I could reassure you that the answer is in the negative. The commodity most needed to address this problem is space. However, as urban areas grow, the abundance of waste also increases.Where once ample disposal sites were available, now every municipal government is scrambling to comply with and uphold local and national health regulations.Large metropolitan cities are having an especially difficult time. Local recycling programs have been authorized in many localities to safeguard the country's ecology.Even after the establishment of such token measures, reports from five consecutive years have indicated only negligible progress in solving this very perplexing problem.If we are to seriously address the problem we will need to minimize the amount of refuse we dispose of. New areas will need to be allocated for this purpose.The database of information collected should be detailed enough to responsibly direct our future actions.Every community, whether large or small, is searching for a solution to this problem. Municipalities, in attempting to appraise the situation, have spent countless years in research, expending both time and money, looking for a homogeneous answer.The public, hoping to avoid the tragic consequences of a manipulated decision, refuses to give enthusiastic support to most proposals. Solicitors are hired to prepare confidential reports to convince the public to accept the municipalities suggestions.The choice of a specific piece of farmland as a landfill site often causes an instantaneous hysterical reaction. At local meetings citizens reproach government officials yelling their disapproval at the choice of a specific site.They vent their anger but are not always able to mobilize sufficient public support to effect a wise and acceptable decision.Even though researchers claim that lined pits will not cause a drainage problem, the room for error is marginal. One flaw in the plan could be responsible for an epidemic or worse, causing multiple deaths. Any leaching from a landfill pit will create recurring difficulties in polluting a farmer's well and the ground water. Polluted water flowing into lakes will affect fish and wildlife and will hinder the sportsman's pleasures.To articulate their concerns beforehand, will hopefully avoid grief in the future. A veiled threat to public health immediately creates a bias towards protecting the people's safety and interests and establishing an educated suspicion.The choice of using remote barren land removed from highly populated areas, virgin ground so to speak, presents its own problems. The transportation of dangerous chemicals in sealed capsules over major arteries increases the possibility of spills and contamination.Recurring excerpts in national and local newspapers warn of the dangers confronting the ordinary citizen. The pretext of protecting the public interest must be questioned. Accidents and poor planning lead to the erosion of public faith.With certainty, we can report that the air we breathe is becoming more polluted daily.For those residents of large cities who are afflicted with a respiratory condition it becomes imperative for officials to clamp down on smog conditions.To protect their health, citizens may deem it necessary to check smog levels beforehand when they are planning strenuous outdoor activity.To disregard this problem will surely increase the number of premature deaths and serious health problems.Direct action by governments should help alleviate some of the risks for the elderly and those people with heart and lung disease.One breakthrough occurred when the government signed a pact to check pollutant emissions on all motor vehicles.Some continuity of policy is desirable not only between provinces but among nations to monitor air quality.On a global scale the deforestation of the rain forests of Brazil is causing grave worldwide concern. The present day regime that is encouraging the building of roads, allowing for easier travel has laid siege to one of the world's most valuable natural resources. This has become an obscene rape of the land, a slash and burn approach. An aerial view of this area shows terrible fires, enormous blazes every day, resulting in consequent air pollution.The Brazilian government however, is reluctant to abolish this practice that would mean less income for the poor of Brazil. Sadly, on the other hand, natives must evacuate their homes,becoming exiles.A world forum on this matter has left people all over the world with some indefinite answers.Both governments and individuals can voluntarily help achieve goals for a cleaner safer environment by incorporating some of the following ideas into their daily lives. They can ascribe to the idea of participating in local recycling programs. As well, they can cut back on the use of motor vehicles.Walking more will improve everyone's health, as well as improving the environment. Using alternatives to herbicides on lawns and gardens will improve water quality. Some general advice might be to differentiate between what we need and what we want.If we are going to pass on a healthy world to our children and grandchildren we must remain diligent and maintain a balance between our environmental and social responsibilities and our economic goals. It's our world and how we leave it for the next generation depends on what we do today.12.	The American DreamThe dream to construct a building to house everyone and everything connected with world trade began in the early 1960's.After much deliberation��Minoru Yamasaki was commissioned over more than a dozen other architects to work with the firm of Emery Roth and Sons to design this massive edifice.His task was evident: the building must have twelve million square feet of floor space on a sixteen acre parcel of land, accommodate the new facilities for the Hudson tubes and subway connections, and be done within the 500 million dollar budget.The relatively small site combined with the vast space needs meant that the only way to go was up. The development would dwarf its neighbors and change the New York landscape and skyline at the bottom of http://Manhattan.In order to accommodate the nine million square feet of office space, Yamasaki made the decision that a two tower development would be best.This would serve the dual purpose of giving sufficient office area on each floor and allowing a manageable structural system while taking advantage of the superb views. The twin towers would be 110 floors each, rising to a height of 1,353 feet (412 meters).From the observation decks at the tops of the towers it would be possible to see 45 miles in every direction.When asked why he designed two 110-storey buildings instead of one 220-storey building,he replied, flippantly, ��I didn��t want to lose the human touch.��The first act in the construction process was the excavation.The 1.2 million cubic yards of earth and rock that were removed were used to create 23 acres of fill in the Hudson River adjacent to the W.T.C. site. This landfill project was subsequently developed as Battery Park. The excavation, besides providing the foundation for this enormous construction, would house parking garages, subway terminals and tubes,and shopping concourses.Yamasaki believed that all buildings must be strong in the context of being dominant. He felt that each building should ��be a monument to the virility of our society��. The structural system,while possessing this strength, is also impressively simple.The 208-foot front wall is essentially a pre-assembled steel web, with columns on 39��inch centers, providing the wind bracing necessary for a building of this height,allowing the central core to take only the gravity loads. This very light, economical configuration would result in keeping the wind bracing in the most efficient place, the outside shell of the http://building.In this way, the wind force would not be transferred through the floor membrane to the core.Thirty��three inch deep floors made of prefabricated steel trusses would act as supports to stiffen the outside walls against the buckling forces of the wind��load pressures. There would be no interior columns in the office spaces, an amazing feat as there would be 40 000 square feet of office space on each of the upper floors.In total, there would be seven buildings in the complex; the twin towers standing 110 stories high , four smaller towers, and a central plaza.Also, there would be seven underground levels containing services, shopping, parking garages and a subway station.When completed, there would be ten million square feet of leasable space, or an acre of rentable space on each floor of each tower.The elevator system was intended to be fast,efficient,and space saving.Express elevators opening onto the forty-first and seventy-fourth floors would serve the sky lobbies. From these floors and from the plaza, four banks of elevators would carry passengers to each of the three zones.Tenders posted, contractors hired, and the preliminary materials purchased, the groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 5, 1966. Some offices were ready for occupancy in 1970 but the ribbon cutting ceremony wasn't held until April 4, 1973. Final cost 750 million dollars.The institution of the W.T.C. would become a symbol of commerce and economic superiority to the world. International businesses recognized that it would be advantageous to have offices there.Thus, the working population of the W.T.C. would incorporate a cross-section of nationalities, not just Americans.The buildings would be occupied by as many as fifty thousand people daily during the week. Additionally,thousands of tourists could be in the center at any given time, visiting the restaurant, Windows on the World, atop One W.T.C., the indoor and outdoor observation decks on Two W.T.C., as well as the shops, exhibition pavilions, and the 250 room hotel.A complex of this size is not without some problems, including fire. Numerous small fires and one major one on February 13, 1975 occurred over the years. However, on February 26, 1993, a terrorist attack on the W.T.C. caused the largest incident ever handled by the City of New York's Fire Department.The blaze, resulting from the ignition of a nitrourea bomb,with hydrogen cylinders to add impact,and located in the parking garage,required the response of 84 engine companies, 60 truck companies, and hundreds of personnel.Firefighters maintained a presence at the site for 28 days, guarding against the possibility of further fires caused by the blast. Six people died and 1042 were injured. The towers survived. After this violent incident failed in its intended purpose of destroying the W.T.C., who could have envisaged an assault as disastrous as the one inflicted on it and the United States on September 11, 2001? Who could have conceived an attack so vicious it would eclipse almost every man��made catastrophe?Who could have foreseen that the American dream would blur into a terrible nightmare?At 8��45 a.m. New York local time, a hijacked 767 commercial airliner with a full load of jet fuel for a transcontinentalflight collided with One W.T.C.,The north tower, with enough impetus to carry it through to the opposite side. Initially, terrorism was not a consideration in the mind of the public. This was merely a dreadful accident.As a bewildered public endeavored to assimilate this overwhelming event,at 9��03 a.m., a second hijacked jet crashed into Two W.T.C.Millions of people around the world, having been alerted to the incident and now watching the terror unfold on their televisions, watched in shock as the second plane, in the blink of an eye, entered the south tower at approximately the seventy-second floor and partially exited the opposite wall.Fire and police departments were mobilized immediately. Rapid evacuation of the buildings was crucial. Many workers on upper floors, knowing there was no escape, committed suicide by hurling themselves out of windows to their deaths. Then, 62 minutes after it had been crashed into, the south tower crumbled into the streets in a gigantic cloud of dust and debris.Hundreds of police and firefighters intent on their rescue mission lost their lives as Two W.T.C. collapsed.Drivers and attendants of emergency vehicles,unable to abandon their posts, died where they had stopped to give aid and assistance.Employees from the two towers, rushing to escape the raging fires, were caught in the wreckage. Pedestrians, uncertain of which way to turn, and not convinced of the need for urgency,found themselves trapped in an avalanche of concrete.Members of the media,on their way to cover the breaking news of the disaster,became victims of it. Hundreds of commuters, on their way to work via subway,were trapped below ground with no escape possible.Hospital emergency departments, having been notified of the explosions,quickly prepared for the arrival of casualties. When the expected influx failed to materialize, it could only mean that there were few survivors.One W.T.C. collapsed at 10��30 a.m., 105 minutes after being hit, adding to the mass confusion in the streets. Seven W.T.C., a later addition to the complex,was damaged,caught fire, and collapsed later that afternoon.Not one of the adjoining structures was left http://intact.In the aftermath of this incredible misfortune,the pieces of the puzzle began to be put in place. Shortly before 8��00 a.m. on September 11, 2001, three commercial airliners were hijackedfrom Logan Airport in Boston, Massachusetts. All were transcontinental flights with passengers destined for California and their full fuel tanks provided the ammunition critical to the mission of the hijackers.Authorities speculate that the pilots were assassinated and their places taken by the terroristswho had had flight training. In all, there were 157 passengers and crew on the two planes. The third plane crashed in Pennsylvania killing 45 passengers and crew.A number of the hostages managed to use their cellular telephones to call their families to say goodbye. Everything occurred in such a short period of time that,other than alerting a handful of people that there were some hijackings, no one had any idea why. The dilemma was that there were no warnings, no demands for ransom, and no hints that this bright, sunny September morning was about to become a day that will live forever in the minds of those who witnessed the tragedy.It will be years before the final toll of damage will be known.To consolidate information,compute the financial losses, designate a monetary value for loss of life, fill the void left on the terrain,to make sense of this misfortune intended to undermine the foundation of America is a formidable assignment. We do know that destruction of the World Trade Center cost the lives of more than three thousand innocent people in the buildings, in the hijacked airplanes,and in the surrounding streets.Who can erase the mental images of those planes smashing into the twin towers? Who is unable to visualize the spectacle of terrified men and women jumping to their doom? How can those of us who observed the collapse of the buildings fail to dwell on the loss of life caused by men,cowards,who lacked the fortitud to proclaim war on their alleged enemy?Today, October 22, 2001, nine more corpses were discovered in the rubbl, the first such discovery in several weeks. This may seem trivial when one considers the multitude of people who died. However, the fatalities aren't the only victims of this tragic event. Their families, friends, and colleagues need closure. They need to know with certainty that their loved ones are dead and they need to bury the remains. Unfortunately,most of the casualties will probably never be found because the heat produced by the ignition of jet fuel and the damage incurred by the impact would have instantaneously vaporized everything and everyone in the immediate vicinity.Others, in the buildings or on the streets as the towers collapsed are under so much debris that their bodies may not be found for months.The list of buildings collapsed and damaged includes all seven buildings of the W.T.C.complex comprising W.T.C.6, the U.S. Customs House to the north; W.T.C.3, the 22 story Marriott World Trade Center Hotel just west of Tower Two; W.T.C.4 and 5, the Plaza Buildings, and One Liberty Plaza, a 54 story, 743 foot high building to the east.Firefighters and recovery workers remain on the scene. The fires still smolder beneath the ruins.The American spirit has been bruised and the land has been scarred. The citizens of this powerful nation now realize just how fragile and vulnerable their country is.Nevertheless,they are defiant.They do not consider themselves easy prey for terrorists. They are still optimistic about their place in today's world. They assert that the nightmare visited upon them will be visited upon the perpetrators of this cowardly act.The World Trade Center is no more. The dream of an international axis of business, once a reality,will be revised. Maybe having one place that is so prominent will also be rethought.Whatever the outcome, this massacre has served to strengthen the resolve of a mighty nation. The dream and dreamers will survive.13.	Sex Role StereotypesDuring my career as a Canadian female teacher,I observed many instances of sex role stereotyping throughout the western culture. I was always amazed how quickly young childrenadopted the cultural values.The topic is one of major concerns in the western world, yet there are those people who would ask you to believe that it is not a major issue.People who wish to ignore the situation do not welcome discussions on the topic of gender bias.This type of person evokes an analogy of an ostrich that buries its head in the sand to ignore a problem by avoiding it.Although many of my comments may seem cynical, I give you assurance that they are based on my observation of western society for a number of years. It might be interesting and informative to compare the western world in this respect with eastern cultures.Many studies have been done and the breakdown of reasons examined to determine why gender roles play an important part in the selection of successful candidates for positions in many vocations.These studies have made little impact on diminishing the prevalence of candidates being selected more for their gender than their qualifications. Since the people responsible for hiring people to work with them, often hire people similar to themselves, it seems like they are looking for a clone or a duplicate of themselves.Females often become quite indignant when positions that they are well suited for are awarded to malesand ambiguous reasons given to explain why.Is it any wonder that attempts to sue corporations for using unfair hiring and promotion practices are applauded? On the other hand, companies who exhibit fair hiring practices need to be commended for doing so.It has been common in the western world for people to presume that certain professions belong almost exclusively to one gender or the other. The work of an electrician, or work with electronics,or repairing of air-conditioning equipment, might be considered to bemasculine fields of employment.Nursing and childcare vocations are considered feminine occupations. Aviation is another field where people would usually assume that the pilot would be male and the flight attendant would be female, a premise that many times will be invalid.It will be a major breakthrough when both genders are equally represented in the workforce especially in higher level positions. Some individuals would lead you to believe that it would result in the breakdown of society, as we know it today.At times an attempt to prevent subjective views being used to preclude only males being hired by males has been attempted. Laws or policy that attempt to rectify the situation have not been successful in diminishing the problem.An attempt to numerically control the number of positions in a corporation by using a quota system to require equal numbers of males and females to be hired usually meets with little success if the attitudes of the people doing the hiring are subjective and preclude the possibility of fair practises being used.The empirical evidence shown by the numbers makes it easy to show which companies exemplify fairness and would hinder those who only make a feeble attempt to do so.If a company does endeavour to incorporate fairness in their hiring practises, they should be eligible for commendation.A diligent attempt to choose the best person for the position regardless of their gender is only inherent in those companies that can envisage a future with the best possible work force.A dvertisements depict gender bias while promoting products. Looking at merchandise displays in any mall will reveal that a picture of a juvenile lad would be near construction equipment while an ad for perfume would likely show a female. The drawback of this seemingly innocent way of displaying merchandise is that they tend to affirm the bias of the individuals who design them. This is a serious flaw.Maybe the intent was not to be exclusive but that is the end result of the message that is evoked, whether subliminal or overt. An alternate way of viewing the world, with either both genders portrayed or neither with the items, may seem bizarre but marketing specialists have been applauded for making the effort to do so.The hypothesis has been suggested that if this practise were widespread it would facilitate a change for the better in the values that are embedded in our society.When you read a biography in a newspaper in a metropolitan area, you will find that different words are used to describe males and females. In almost any literary work, personal appearance is seldom mentioned when describing males, but commonly used when a female is the subject of the article.Forms of address that are considered proper to use are also discriminatory. Males are always referred to as Mr. (except a very young lad might be addressed as Master). There are several forms of abbreviations to use before the name of a female.It is permissible to use Mrs., Miss, or Ms. The choice of abbreviation is by personal preference of the person being addressed but they have different meanings. Mrs. is used to signify a married woman.Miss means an unmarried or single woman.Ms. could mean either and is the choice of many women because it does not reveal their marital status. How strange that society feels it is necessary to be able to deduce a woman's marital status from her name by providing this form of definitive identification. A man could be married or could be a bachelor and one is not able to ascertain his marital status from his name.Why, then, is it necessary to differentiate between a woman who is married and one who is not?Many of the cases of sexual harassment that are dealt with in corporations are a result of stereotyping. Usually the person who is the alleged harasser is a male who supervises females.Males have been taught by society that they are the privileged gender and have power over any female. This is the basisbehind most incidents of harassment.How strange that intelligent men feel entitled to take advantage of females in a subordinate position.To heighten awareness, forums or symposiums are held to enlighten people about the importance of using inclusive language but may people still resist changing.Some people are determined that the word man also includes woman. Sometimes the meaning does incorporate women and sometimes it doesn��t.However, many woman insist that they are never quite sure of the meaning and suggest that the word humanity should be used instead when the intended meaning is both men and women and then there would be no confusion.It is incomprehensible to others why they refuse to change. A booklet or pamphlet is available for reference in most work places to help people use inclusive language in any writing in the workplace.Some government offices have produced a leaflet that can be used by companies that do not have the impetus or the resources to design their own.Studies about gender differences have suggested a hypothesis that females have better verbal skills, while males excel at tasks requiring the ability to visualize.Conclusions of many of the studies have proved it invalid and found instead the differences between the genders to be almost nil. There are, however, notable differences between individuals regardless of their gender.The absurd criterion for judging a person's ability based on their gender needs to be abolished. Until this is seen as being abnormal, the attempt to updated attitudes without removing the underlying cause of the societal values will be useless.14.	Dr. Sun Yat-sen: Father of the Chinese RevolutionDr. Sun Yat-sen held official political office for a total of only a few months in China, yet he had an impact so profound that it earned him the designation of Father of the Chinese Revolution.He was a man who is still much revered in China. His portrait can be seen in Tiananmen Square in Beijing.Sun was born in 1866 in Guangdong Province. His ancestors were clans of farmers and shepherds.During his adolescent years, he attended school in Honolulu and Hong Kong.In the latter city, he studied medicine, receiving an ��A�� in every subject in the program, an unprecedented feat at Hong Kong Medical College (later, the University of Hong Kong). While in Hong Kong, Sun undertook conversion to Roman Catholicism.Early in life, Sun developed contempt for the corruption of the Qing (Manchu) Dynasty.He was also vocal in denouncing foreign intrusions and aggression against China during the 19th century.The opium war of 1839 to 1842was a major testimony to China's inability to defend itself against outside aggression. By this period, Britain had developed a strong monopoly in the trade of many goods, including tea, salt, opium, and other commodities.This monopoly was exercised mostly through the British East India Company. Britain had been importing much from China, but was exporting little. This resulted in a yearly balance of payments deficit with China.To correct this imbalance in trade, and the fact that opium was a highly addictive drug, the arrogant British forced the export of opium on China, even though opium was declared illegal by the latter. China's attempt to resist these aggressive trade practices precipitated the bloody Opium War of 1839 to 1842.Thousands were massacred as China lost miserably against superior forces.The Treaty of Nanking in 1842 dictated that China pay huge compensation to Britain and it forced China to open five of its ports to British trade.Britain also demanded and received immunity from Chinese laws, therefore gaining British sovereignty over small parts of a foreign land. Hong Kong was ceded to Britain as well.The Chinese endured repression and humiliation for many decades.In 1896, the United States, relative newcomers to the club of world imperialists, declared an Open Door policy for trading with China.No foreign country was to have a monopoly of trade with China.During the 19th century, many foreign countries successfully carved out pieces of China for themselves. Geographically, by 1911, China was a significantly smaller country than it was in 1800.In the middle of the 19th century, China was also going through some very grim times, economically. There were famines, floods, and droughts. There was much suffering and deprivation, especially in the southern areas of China. The Qing dynasty did very little to relieve the people of their plight.These conditions, along with the humiliating concessions being forced on them by foreign powers, culminated in a mass of violent eruptions and disturbances against the Qing Dynasty, which became known asthe Taiping Rebellion from 1851 to 1864.The Opium Wars, the Taiping Rebellion, and later, in 1900, the Boxer Rebellion, were constant reminders of government corruption and China's weakness against foreign intrusion and manipulation. With these tragic misfortunes in recent modern Chinese history on his mind, Sun came to the conclusion that the only way that China could truly become a strong unified country once again, was by full��scale revolution.This should beginwith capturing the Qing throne, terminating millennia of imperial rule in China. He also realized that a more militant approach was needed if he was going to achieve his goals.Blundering in the first attempt to overthrow the Manchus in 1895, Sun fled from China and embarked upon an unexpected 16 years of world travel and refection. This period proved instrumental in Sun's development of revolutionary strategy and theory.He enrolled support from Chinese people living in other countries. He visited Hawaii, the United States, Britain, and Japan. He elicited help wherever he could. He read some of works of Karl Marx and those of Henry George.George was an American economist and social philosopher who saw the injustice of land policy during the building of railroads into the American west in the second half of the 19th century.George observed that most people who moved west remained poor or got poorer, while the relatively few land developersgot richer and richer. The advertisement��Go west young man and prosper��meant, in reality, that only a very few would prosper.George suggested, without success, that a heavy land tax be leviedto tap some of this wealth in order to develop a solid infrastructure from which all people in the west, not just the rich, could benefit.Sun also had the opportunity to study republican forms of government such as that of the United States. He became even more convinced that China had to break away from the millennia��old imperial government system,concluding that a republican system was the answer for China.He was impressed with Montesquieu's principle of the separation of government powers. This theory stated that the three branches of government, the executive, legislative, and judicial, function separately.He saw this in practice, particularly in the United States. He later concluded that for China, two additional separated powers, examination and censorial would be necessary.While in London, Sun received an unexpected boost to his efforts of eliciting help for his cause. While on his way there, in 1896, he was kidnapped and held in the Chinese (Qing) Embassy.He managed to sneak a message to a friend who talked to the press. This created an embarrassing situation for the Chinese government, which consequently, released Sun.The Chinese portrayed Sun as insane or as an idiot. This incident, along with a popular book that he wrote about the experience, magnified his reputation internationally. In Japan, shortly after, he was welcomed as an international celebrity.In order to carry out a successful revolution, he realized that his agenda required the support of intellectuals. To enroll the support of the latter, he needed a well thought-out plan or theory. From this realization, the doctrine of The Three Principles of the People was disclosed.The three were nationalism, democracy, and the people's livelihood. Nationalism was interpreted initially to mean anti Manchu, while democracy meant a republican form of government.The people's livelihood was perceived as state ownership of property. This would be the solution to avoid the problemsof economic inequalities experienced in the west. Given his knowledge of the west's experience, Sun saw this approach for China as more practical and reliable.His plan for revolution suggested three stages: military rule, political tutelage,and constitutional government. He saw that military rule was needed for a period of time to rid China of lingering corruption from the Qing period, and to create an environment of stability to create the new Chinese society.Political tutelage guardianship, for perhaps three years,was needed to gradually develop a stronger,more permanent political system, and to acclimatize the Chinese people to these political changes.After six years, China might be ready for a permanent constitutional republican government.He sincerely hoped that his plan would permeate China with widespread acceptance.In 1905, while in Japan, Sun was instrumental in setting up the United League of China. The Wuchang (Wuhan) Revolt, in October of 1911, brought Sun Yat-sen to Shanghai. Shortly after the successful overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, Sun was elected Interim President of the new Republic of China in Nanking, the capital.This government immediately set out to develop a provisional(temporary) constitution. However, by February of 1912, Sun resigned as president to give way to Yuan Shikai, who brought with him a lot of support from the north, which provided the opportunity to unify greater parts of China.Also in 1912, the United League of China set up the Kuomingtang (KMT), the National Party of China. Yuan Shikai, in the meantime betrayed the republic and Sun's trust, by attempting to set himself up as a dictator.Sun immediately proceeded in pursuit of Yuan but was unsuccessful and had to go into exile in Japan. In 1924, the Kuomingtang convened at Guangzhou to establish three principles to solidify and strengthen the republic and to unify the rest of China.These principles included developing an alliance with Russia,helping farmers, workers, and bourgeoisie, and recommending a national conference to end the brutal, unequal treaties imposed by foreign nations.The result was ��the Declaration of Beijing��, the last official act of Dr. Sun Yat-sen before liver cancer took his life in March of 1925.Sun Yat-sen was widely mourned as tributes came in from all over. Many intellectuals saw Sun as a man of action, a pragmatist, and not as a great intellectual.Throughout his life, he was not above contradicting his own principles, or tolerating opposing views or parties to further his cause. For Sun, during these turbulent times, the end sometimes did seem to justify the means.His philosophy changed, over time, to meet changing needs.For many academics, Sun's career was not seen as the making of a myth, but as a real man dealing with real complex realities of his time. His presence, inside and outside of China, dominated Chinese history during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He adopted and tailored western ideas to the Chinese experience, in order to create his vision of a new China. Many academics also felt that Sun's western experiences greatly influenced his work and contributed to his predominant place in Chinese and world history.Before he died, he stated that the whole nation had to be awakened and united with those who treated them equally, and fight side by side with them.Sun Yat-sen had received the respect of people throughout the world, even from non-communist sources.In China, he became a legend. When the Kuomingtang and the Communists split in 1927, both claimed to be heirs of his work.No one can deny Sun Yat-sen his rightful place, not only in Chinese historybut also in world history. He truly deserves the title and honour of Father of the Chinese Revolution.15.	The World Trade Organization(WTO) and ChinaAs China has been admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO), it is very apt at this time to compile some important data about this international organization. The conception of the WTO took place during the 1995 Uruguay round of talks of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The WTO actually replaced GATT.This latter organization, a composite of many countries, was formed after the Second World War to preside over the stabilization of trade among nations. The new organization, the WTO, is dedicated to allocating the resources of the world by using fairer trade practices and providing economic security for the more vulnerable, less developed nations.The WTO provides the apparatus for making this happen through increased cooperation among member countries. The execution of such agreements will be instrumental in enhancing the esteem of less developed members and will provide a more stable infrastructure for profitable trade for members of the WTO.Is there a way to describe in simple terms what this is all about? What underlies this international pursuit of free trade among nations? Students of introductory Economics would recognize the theory of ��comparative advantage��.Briefly, this economic theory states that a country can produce all or most goods and services more efficiently than most or all other countries, but still gain from specializing in production and trading with other nations.They not only receive economic benefits for themselves, but also help other countries achieve similar benefits in the process. Let's look at a simple example.Assume that there are two countries, Alpha and Beta, that produce the same two products, bananas and office desks, and nothing else. We will assume that each country has 200 units of productive resources (resources such as land,labour and capital, used in the production of bananas and desks). In this case we will use labour. Before trading each country, using the productive resources each has available, might produce the following combinations:Bananas��tons�� Alpha 300 (100 units of labour) Beta 100(100 units) Totals 400 Desks Alpha 100 (100 units) Beta 25 (100 units) Totals 125Assuming that each country used the same amount of productive resources in the production of both bananas and desks,you will notice that Alpha produced more bananas and more desks than Beta but produced desks more efficiently (higher ratio 4��1) than bananas (3��1).Alpha produced four times as many desks as Beta given equal units of resources (100 units) and three times as many bananas as Beta. Alpha has a comparative advantage in producing desks and therefore could make economic gains by transferring some of its labour resources into the production of desks. If the two countries were agreeable to specialize and trade with each other, the following might be possible:Bananas��tons��Alpha 210(70 units) Beta 200(200 units) Total410Desks Alpha 130(130 units)Beta 0(0 units) Total 130This example shows that, by specialization by each partner, total production of bananas would increase from 400 tons to 410 tons and the production of desks would increase from 125 to 130 desks.This means that more of each product would be available to both countries to share through specialization and trade. This may be an oversimplification of the concept of comparative advantage, but it is the economic principle which explains why countries want more free trade, and why China wants to join the WTO.It also explains the United State's ambitious pursuit of freer trade arrangements throughout the world.Immersed for more than a decade in negotiations, the climax has been reached for China.Its official membership in the WTO commenced in December 2001. It has not been an easy road to reach this goal and the country will now embark upon an even tougher road of more formidable challenges.Many issues surrounding China's bid are not only economic, but also social in nature. For example, the United States has amplified the issue of human rights in discussions between itself and China.The reasons for this obsession over human rights are not readily evident, but in some quarters suggestions for it have been offered. Since the end of the Cold War, and the demise (or fall) of the Soviet Union, the United States has had no clear opponent to justify the work of its many agencies that were originally assimilated to deal with former Cold War opponents.The promotion of international human rights allegedly has filled part of this void, to become the major target of the new direction in American foreign policy, and it has become commonplace for China in particular.It should be noted that there are some current members of the WTO that have worse human rights records than that of China but were not treated in the same manner.Also, it is erroneous to suggest that the United States itself is completely innocent of human rights violations.This is a major contradiction in current American foreign policy. It is also suggested that the real threat to the United States is that China is a huge country with a robust economy that has been growing by leaps and bounds over the last twenty years.Henceforth, a fear is growing that the potential economic strength of China will threaten the prevalent position of the United States in world affairs.More recently,during the spy plane incident over Hainan,American President Bush changed the American position toward China from that of being a world partner(the approach of the Clinton Administration),to that of being a competitor or an opponent in international affairs.This ��bashing�� propaganda about China is considered by many people a cover-up (or a smoke screen) for growing American insecurity in international affairs and this distortion is accumulative in the brain washed minds of the American people.It is also degrading to say the least. It is like a champion football team that does not want to play fairly any more because it is afraid of losing. It is the fear of being beaten fairly and decisively on the field, according to an agreed upon set of rules.This obsession with human rights has flared up in many areas of American foreign policy in recent months. This rash, sometimes graphic China Bashing attitudeis probably driven, in part, by powerful economic interests in the United States.The positions of these powerful interests will be seriously threatened by China's entry into the WTO. These industries, if they are forced to face stronger competition, fear losing their shares of their respective markets.These same interests also heavily support political parties financially and therefore have some indirect influence over government policies. China has enough ballots to get into the WTO.The United States alone cannot veto China's entry, but can make things difficult.Both China and the United States will have to adjust themselves to raise economic efficiencies, a fact that normally results from greater competition.However, what must clearly be seen are the comparative advantages, which will benefit all trading partners. With the reduction of trade barriers, more efficient use of the world's productive resources will emerge through greater specialization by the various countries involved.In the short-run, (in the first few years) there will be dislocations of productive resources, particularly of labour. For some industries, the future will be bleak. There will be short run unemployment in some sectors of each country.It is important that these countries develop plans, such as retraining and increased technology, to make adjustments easier as productive resources shift from one sector to another. With greater sharing of international expertise, these transitions should become easier.The long range result will mean more benefits for all countries; meaning higher standards of living all round. China has already made persistent strides in this direction through its partnership arrangements with foreign corporations over the last twenty years, since the reforms at the end of the Cultural Revolution.China has no alternative but to move forward into the international markets and in other areas of globalization of the twenty first century. Not to do so would mean inevitable deterioration or, perhaps, even complete evaporation of China's strong economy.Some sacrifices in socialist economic and political philosophies and policies are imperative if these goals are to be achieved. The big advantage that China has had over the former Soviet Unionis that of cautious gradualism in economic policy.China's political hierarchy is slowly embracing the theories and practices of a new socialist market system. The knowledge and skills gained from this approach places China in an excellent position to succeed.The country sees quite clearly that a pure command economic system will not endure to the end under the inertia of this epoch of brisk globalization. In the end, China is destined to succeed.Much of what China will face in the WTO will be the coincidence of internal policies that have been formulated in recent years, although some reconfiguration will be necessary.To suggest immediate success for China may be premature at this point, but there are precedents that are favourable to China's aspirations. Such success is difficult to quantify or generalize, as there are so many factors that are constantly changing.It is a gamble. World recessions, strong economic growth periods, and disasters such as the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, can drastically create economic casualties overnight followed by the ��trickle down�� negative impacts.All these being said, it would be a mistake to underestimate China's legitimate presence in this period of globalization. It is indicative, as well as fitting,that almost all countries of the world will benefit from the potential contributions that China can make in the years to come.The WTO's success hinges on international cooperation and ceaseless pursuit of positive common goals rather than focusing on negative issues that could only handicap good economic and social relations along with progress in international trade.It is hoped that such barriers between China and other countries will dissipate now that its membership has finally been certified.
